# Firebase-Assignment---Train-Scheduler

This is my Train Scheduler assignment. I built the html framework using Tailwind CSS to try out a different CSS framework. On the whole, I really like it, but there were a couple of items that took me a little while to figure out and I'm still not sure if that's how I should have done it. I also couldn't really get responsiveness to work on my tables, so that doesn't look great on small viewports.

I was able to add in the real time updating for the train time and the next train. I added in a remove button that removes the information from the table row as well as from Firebase. I received an email from Gitlab once I added that in saying they don't recommend that, so I'm not sure if I should remove that or not...

I was also able to add in error checking on my train fields to make sure the users can't make invalid entries.
